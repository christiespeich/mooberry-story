Organize multiple posts into a story. Make it easy for readers to find your stories, including older ones.

== Description ==

Mooberry Story helps you post an ongoing story to your blog by grouping the posts into a single story. Display a table of contents, re-arrange the order of the posts within the story, and draw attention to your story with sidebar widgets.

After activating Mooberry Story, use the Stories menu to add stories to your website. Write the chapters/episodes/etc. as blog posts, and select the story they belong to.

If you have stories you've already posted on your blog, you can still use Mooberry Story to organize them simply by:

1. Adding the story in the Stories menu

2. Finding all the posts that belong to that story

3. Selecting the story on each post and updating the post

4. Re-order the posts on the Edit Story page if necessary

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `mooberry-story` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==
1. Add Stories to your blog via the Stories menu. Several customization options available.
2. Each chapter of your story is a new blog post. Simply select the story it belongs to from a drop down list.
3. Each story gets its own page to display the title, cover art, summary, and table of contents.
4. Each chapter of your story displays like a blog post, with a little extra formatting for the titles.
5. Each chapter has navigation links at the top and bottom for the next chapter, previous chapter, and table of contents.
6. Two widgets and multiple options allow you to highlight stories on your sidebar so readers can find them easily.
